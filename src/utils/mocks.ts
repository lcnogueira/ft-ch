Filled with artisanal crafts and botanicals, including ceramics, original artwork, textiles and homewares, the boutique offers an array of products to transform an interior space into one less ordinary.

      'Founded by Elizabeth Drew as a place to sell her handmade leather goods, Osmology naturally progressed to focus on her other passion, specialist home scents and candles. Now a destination for customers seeking hand-poured, quality scents, Elizabeth is careful to select brands that only pour small batches to ensure this is never compromised. Osmology is a curated collection of the best of candles alongside often handmade or UK sourced lifestyle products.',
