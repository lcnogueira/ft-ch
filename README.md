# Trouva Frontend Challenge

<!-- ![ci](https://github.com/lcnogueira/nextjs-boilerplate/workflows/ci/badge.svg) -->

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below in order to run your project locally:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Copy the `.env-sample` file to `.env.local` and update the values.

**P.S.: if you don't have a `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY`, a leaflet default map will be rendered (rather than a Mapbox one)**

3. Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
